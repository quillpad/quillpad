## Hello!
I have created this fork that adds extra color options for notes as i recently migrated from Google Keep and found the options lacking for me.. 

These are all the colors listed in order that they appear in this fork, all where adjusted to be as similar to the 12 available in Google Keep:
- **DEFAULT** (White and Black)
- **RED**
- **ORANGE**
- **YELLOW**
- **GREEN**
- **TEAL**
- **CYAN**
- **BLUE**
- **PURPLE**
- **PINK**
- **BROWN**
- **GRAY**


I have also added two themes for the app:
- **BLUE**
- **RED** -- NEW!
- **YELLOW** -- NEW!
- **PINK**
- **ORANGE** (color slightly adjusted to be more orange)
- **PURPLE**

# Quillpad
Quillpad is fully free and open-source. It will never show you ads, ask you for unnecessary permissions or upload your notes anywhere without you knowing.

Take beautiful markdown notes whenever you feel inspired. Place them in notebooks and tag them accordingly. Stay organized by making task lists, set reminders and keep everything in one place by attaching related files.

### Fork Info

Quillpad is a fork of an original app called [Quillnote](https://github.com/msoultanidis/quillnote). The development
stopped on the original app and PR backlogs were not cleared up. The community showed much interest in the app for
continued development and so this fork was
created. https://github.com/msoultanidis/quillnote/issues/177 https://github.com/msoultanidis/quillnote/issues/209
